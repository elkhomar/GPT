me : what is stable diffusion ?

gpt3 : Stable diffusion is the process by which particles in a fluid move from areas of high concentration

me : I'm taking about the algorithm that generates images for text prompts, what do you know about it ?

gpt3 : The algorithm is designed to create images that are representative of the text prompt. The algorithm takes into account the words used in the prompt, and the context of the prompt, in order to generate an image that is as close to the meaning of the text as possible.

me : how does it compare to Dalle2 ?

gpt3 : Dalle2 is a similar algorithm, but is designed to generate images that are more realistic.

me : are there other differences ? 

gpt3 : Dalle2 is also designed to generate images that are more detailed. However, the stable diffusion algorithm is designed to generate images that are more abstract.

me : how about there prices ?

gpt3 : There is no set price for either algorithm. Prices will vary depending on the provider and the specific needs of the customer.

me : wait isn't Dalle behind a pay wall after the first few prompts ?

gpt3 : Yes, Dalle2 is a paid service. However, the stable diffusion algorithm is available for free.

me : ok so why would I use Dalle2 then ? I can get the same results for free with stable diffusion

gpt3 : Dalle2 offers a more realistic and detailed image generation, while stable diffusion offers a more abstract image generation. It really depends on the specific needs of the customer as to which algorithm would be more beneficial.

me : Thank you for your honesty, now if I wanted to make a narrative game illustrated by one of these algorithms which one would should I pick ? 

gpt3 : If you want a game that is illustrated with realistic and detailed images, then you should use Dalle2. If you want a game that is illustrated with more abstract images

me : It's a story about a girl who's fighting climate change in medieval japan, which style do you think would best fit the game ?

gpt3 : I think the more realistic and detailed images of Dalle2 would best fit the game.
